Run with:

`python main.py *frequency* *difficulty* *game_mode*`  

`frequency` is how often a new chord appears (10 is resonable)

`difficulty` is how diffucult the chords would be (between 1 and 5)

`game_mode` affects how the chord would be displayed where:
    `all` is 0,
    `only chord` is 1,
    `delayed chord` is 2,
    `only name` is 3,
    `delayed name` is 4;
